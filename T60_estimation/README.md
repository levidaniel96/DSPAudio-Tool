# Estimating T60 from Audio Signals

This code is part of our final project for the B.Sc in Electrical Engineering at Bar Ilan University, developed by Daniel Levi and Adi Cohen.

## Usage

To run the code, execute the `T60_main.py` file. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

### Input Requirements

- This code works with WAV audio files.
- The input audio recording should be at least 4 seconds long.

### Output

The output of the code is the T60 value of the room, indicating the reverberation time.

## Running the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/levidaniel96/DSPAudio-Tool.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd T60_estimation
    ```

3. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python T60_main.py
    ```
