# Estimating T60 from Audio Signals

This code is part of our final project for the B.Sc in Electrical Engineering at Bar Ilan University, developed by Daniel Levi and Adi Cohen.

## Usage

To run the code, execute the `T60_main.py` file. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

### Input Requirements

- This code works with WAV audio files.
- The input audio recording should be at least 4 seconds long.

### Output

The output of the code is the T60 value of the room, indicating the reverberation time.
